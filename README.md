Project Name - 

Auto Instagram Posting with Dynamic Data

Tagline -

Post Variable data with the same layout at regular intervals automatically on a timely basis through a python script on Instagram.

The problem it solves - 

-> Reducing the need for manually post dynamic data in the same format at regular intervals
-> Infinite scope of building an automated Instagram Page to provide information on a timely basis
-> Users can easily see the required information on their Instagram Feed
-> Removing Redundant task of managing an Instagram page

Challenges I ran into -
-> I first tried a lot of techniques to convert the edited PPT file to an Image file and finally I stuck to Aspose Library for that but still I am not satisfied by the result as there is a watermark in the final image
-> I messed a lot with Facebook Graph API and there were some permissions which were required from the facebook end for this to work and they took time but still the Facebook Graph API was a bit confusing so I tried other methods which weren't scaleable and the proper way to post automatically on Facebook's Instagram.
-> I also tried to use the Google Cloud Console VM to run the Python Script all times but it tends to end after the session was closed by me but then I researched and found out about linux tool "tmux" and the script in running on a separate session all times.
